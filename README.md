# Speech synthesis
The best and easiest way to implement A.I. speech recognition using PyTorch. There are 108 voices, where 0 is the first id and 107 is the last voice id. I use a mac with an m1 chip, with the metal mps booster, which is specially tailored for this code, but it can work without this too.
Download the A.I. models from my google drive using this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zZTkl1QvG5kEVl9-VfFyBKvtbF9QQTpV?usp=share_link

### Run Speech Synthisis Pytorch.py to start the code.
